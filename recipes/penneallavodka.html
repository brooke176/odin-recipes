        <h4>Penne alla Vodka is my favorite pasta!</h4>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup good olive oil</li>
                <li>2½ cups chopped yellow onions (2 onions)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves)</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 cup vodka</li>
                <li>2 (28 ounce) cans whole peeled plum tomatoes</li>
                <li>kosher salt and black pepper</li>
                <li>3/4 pound penne pasta</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/2 freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a medium (11-inch) Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset, over medium-low heat.  Add the onions and cook for about 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent.  Add the garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook for just one minute.  Add the vodka and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, until the mixture is reduced by half.   With clean hands, crush each tomato into the pot.  Add 2 teaspoons of salt and ½ teaspoon of black pepper.  Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and bake for 1½ hours.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add 2 tablespoons of salt and the pasta and cook according the directions on the package.  Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Pour the tomato mixture into a food processor fitted with the steel blade and puree until smooth.  (You can also use a blender.)  Return the tomato mixture to the pot.  Add the fresh oregano, cream, 1 teaspoon of salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper and simmer partially covered for 10 minutes.  Add the pasta to the sauce and cook for 2 more minutes.  Off the heat, stir in ½ cup of the Parmesan cheese and serve hot sprinkled with extra Parmesan and fresh oregano.</li>
            </ol>
